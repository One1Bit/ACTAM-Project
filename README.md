- The first step for the beginner is to learn the keyboard (F2 to C5).
  When the mouse is near a key, the corresponding note name will be displayed.
By clicking the key, its sound is played.
By clicking 
*Hide/Show the notations* button, you could check the note for each key.

- Then go to the KEY box on the left, where you could learn about the key. 
You need to select a key at first.
The selected contents are:\
 C | D | E | F | G | A | B \
 Natural | Sharp | Flat  \
 Major | Minor \
Then, by clicking *Scale* or *Chord* button, the corresponding notes 
and chords are shown below. Particularly, when clicking *Scale* button,
another *Play* button shows. When clicking it, the sound of the notes in
the scale are played one by one with highlighting of the keys simultaneously.

button to start. Here is the instruction:\
Notes appear randomly on the staff corresponding to 
treble and bass clef. You could input your answer through keyboard on
your computer or click the virtual keyboard above. \
You have 10 seconds to answer. When the progress bar of the timer reaches the end, the time is up. 
If you are wrong the application will dye the correct key into green to help you out. 
The game ends when you go though 5 notes.
