By clicking the key, its sound is played.
By clicking 
*Hide/Show the notations* button, you could check the note for each key.

You need to select a key at first.
The selected contents are:\
 C | D | E | F | G | A | B \
 Natural | Sharp | Flat  \
 Major | Minor \
Then, by clicking *Scale* or *Chord* button, the corresponding notes 
and chords are shown below. Particularly, when clicking *Scale* button,
another *Play* button shows. When clicking it, the sound of the notes in
the scale are played one by one with highlighting of the keys simultaneously.
